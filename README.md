A proof-of-concept application for managing employees, customers, properties, and bookings.

FINAL PROJECT: Case Analysis

Build Dev is a small builder in Korea that focus on building small houses and villas in rural areas. Part of their operation is managing their employees and customers. They are willing to develop a small software to manage their employees, customers, and services. They came up with this decision to lessen their operational cost, have a better understanding of their customer base, and improve the quality of their services. They think that these can be achieved by an automated system to store and retrieve the details of employees, customers, services, and inspection bookings. Before the company invests on the final product, the management have agreed on developing a proof‐of‐concept first. The idea is that your solution will 'prove' that a better solution is possible. From your solution, it is hoped that the requirements from Build Dev can be extracted and a full software development project can be started.

Your proof‐of‐concept should include at least the following functional requirements:
• The user adds a new employee
• The user adds a new customer
• The user adds a new property
• The user adds a new inspection booking
• The user assigns a customer and a property to a booking
• The user prints the list of all bookings
• The user prints the list of all customers
• The user prints the list of all properties

The functional requirements, if proved by your solution, will be supplemented by non-functional requirements in the subsequent requirements gathering exercise. Some of these may be the presentation of options in a graphical user interface, printed reports on letterheads, security or other options that do not matter for the present proof of concept.

In presenting your solution, it is expected that it will compile and run. You should give the user series of options to choose from, if they are to interact with your program. For example, choosing option '1' may be the route the user will take to enter a new employee. Choosing option '2' may be the route to allowing the user to add a new customer and so on.

Hints:
• Before you start programming, you have to identify the main classes that you need to define since you will be using the Object‐Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices to develop the proof‐of‐concept.
• You will need a minimum of four classes and can use variables and arrays to store data.
• You do not need to store ay of data in files since this will be implemented after the approval of the proof‐of concept.
• Your main class or function will be the one that allows you to showcase the capabilities of the proof‐of‐concept. As discussed above, the user should be allowed to have a menu to choose the options.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
1.	A system application that will be use as a proof-of-concept that will be presented to the management of Build Dev in extracting the requirements before the full software development project can be started.
2.	The system should have at least four (4) classes and can use variables and arrays to store data.
3.	The system should be developed using any programming language with object-oriented capability.

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:

I.	Introduction
Provide a general description of the situation Identify all the problems you are going to discuss. Present the assumptions that emerged during the analysis, if any.

II.	Case Evaluation
Describe the detected problems in more detail. Indicate their link to, and effect on, the general situation. Explain why the problems emerged and persist.

III.	Proposed Solutions
